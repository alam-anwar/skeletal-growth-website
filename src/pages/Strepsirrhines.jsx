            <p>Extant primates are divided into two main suborders: strepsirrhines and haplorhines. Strepsirrhines, or “wet-nosed” primates, are named for the presence of a rhinarium, which assists in olfaction and is moistened by the nasolacrimal duct. Strepsirrhines and haplorhines diverged over 70 million years ago and are further divided into the extant infraorders Lemuriformes (lemurs) and Lorisiformes (lorises, pottos, and galagos). Strepsirrhines are generally (though not exclusively) nocturnal and are smaller-bodied with relatively smaller brain volumes. They retain the ancestral trait of a postorbital bar and are typically considered more “primitive.” However, strepsirrhines exhibit derived characteristics, such as a toothcomb, which is an elongated series of incisors and canines furrowed together at the rostral end of their lower dentition. They have a 2.1.3.3 dental formula (with some exceptions), forward facing eyes, and postcranial traits such as a grooming claw. </p>
