            <p>Extant primates are divided into two main suborders: strepsirrhines and haplorhines. Haplorhines diverged over 70 million years ago and are further divided into tarsiers and anthropoids (which include New World monkeys, Old World monkeys, and apes). Haplorhines are primarily diurnal and tend to be more social than their strepsirrhine counterparts. Generally, haplorhines express greater degrees of encephalization compared to most strepsirhines, which has resulted in varying degrees of basicranial flexion across species. Haplorhines are less prognathic and rely heavily on vision, at the expense of reduced olfaction. The most diagnostic characteristic of haplorhine primates is postorbital septation, which evolved from the ancestral condition of a postorbital bar. Anthropoid primates have complete postorbital plates, while tarsiers have only partially complete postorbital septa.</p>
